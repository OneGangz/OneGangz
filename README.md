# 👋 Hi, I’m Gangasarath S

Senior .NET Engineer with 13+ years of experience building backend enterprise systems.  
I focus on **clean architecture**, **maintainable APIs**, and **SQL-first backend design** that survives real production use.

---

## 🧠 What I Work With

- **Languages & Frameworks:** C#, ASP.NET Core, ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web Forms
- **Backend:** REST APIs, Clean Architecture, SOLID Principles, Dependency Injection
- **Database:** SQL Server, T-SQL, Stored Procedures, Query Optimization
- **DevOps & Infra:** Docker, Docker Compose, Linux (Ubuntu), IIS
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Swagger, Postman, Visual Studio

---

## 🏗️ What I Build

- Backend REST APIs with clear separation of concerns
- Enterprise and business applications
- Systems migrating from legacy ASP.NET to modern ASP.NET Core
- SQL-heavy systems where correctness and performance matter
- Containerized local environments for APIs and databases

---

## 📌 Featured Projects

### CleanAPI
A modular ASP.NET Core REST API built using Clean Architecture principles.

**Highlights**
- Domain-driven separation (API / Application / Infrastructure)
- SOLID-compliant service design
- SQL Server integration
- Dockerized API + database
- Health checks and startup dependency handling

---

## 🎯 Professional Focus

I care about:
- Code that is readable six months later
- Architecture that scales without becoming clever
- Backend systems that fail predictably instead of mysteriously
- Practical engineering over hype-driven development
